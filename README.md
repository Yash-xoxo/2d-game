<h2>Overview</h2>
Game Overview: Pong
Goal: Create a simple 2D Pong game where two paddles hit a ball back and forth.
Languages: C#: Handle the gameâ€™s logic and graphics.
Python: Manage scripting for game mechanics and AI for paddle movements.
C++: Optimize performance-critical parts, such as physics (ball movement) and collision detection.
<h3>Tools and Libraries</h3>
C#: Use Unity or MonoGame for the game engine and 2D graphics.
Python: Use Pygame for AI scripting and communication between the game logic.
C++: Use SFML or SDL2 to handle physics and optimize ball movement and collision.
<h3>Project Structure</h3>
C# (Game Logic, Graphics, and Input Handling)
Python (AI and Game Mechanics Scripting)
C++ (Physics and Performance)


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
C#: Main game logic, graphics, and input handling using MonoGame.
Python: AI scripting for controlling the second paddle.
C++: Optimized physics and ball movement handling.
Each language handles a different part of the game, and they communicate with each other through sockets or network protocols to create a smooth experience.

This multi-language approach helps demonstrate how different programming languages can be combined to build a simple 2D game.
